      September 17, 2021.[3][4]

      The series centers on a contest where 456 players, drawn from different
      walks of life but each deeply in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt" target="_blank">debt</a> ,
      play a set of children's games with deadly penalties for losing for the
      chance to win a ₩45.6 billion prize.[a] Hwang had conceived of the idea
      based on his own economic struggles early in life as well as the

      production to support the script until Netflix around 2019 found interest
      as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.
      Hwang wrote and directed all nine episodes himself.
