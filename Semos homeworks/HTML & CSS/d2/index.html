        The American Friend (German: Der amerikanische Freund) is a 1977
        neo-noir film by Wim Wenders, adapted from the 1974 novel Ripley's Game
        by Patricia Highsmith. The film features Dennis Hopper as career
        criminal Tom Ripley and Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Zimmermann, a terminally
        ill picture framer whom Ripley coerces into becoming an assassin. The
        film uses an unusual "natural" language concept: Zimmermann speaks
        German with his family and his doctor, but English with Ripley and while
        visiting Paris.

      <h1>Plot</h1>
      <p>
        Tom Ripley (Dennis Hopper) is a wealthy American living in Hamburg,
        Germany. He is involved in an artwork forgery scheme, in which he
        appears at auctions to bid on forged paintings produced by an accomplice
        to drive up the price. At one of these auctions, he is introduced to
        Jonathan Zimmermann (Bruno Ganz), a picture framer who is dying of
        leukemia. Zimmermann refuses to shake Ripley's hand when introduced,
        coldly saying "I've heard of you" before walking away. A French
        criminal, Raoul Minot (Gérard Blain), asks Ripley to murder a rival
        gangster. Ripley declines, but in order to get even for Zimmermann's
        slight, suggests Minot use Zimmermann for the job. Ripley spreads rumors
        that Zimmerman's illness has suddenly worsened. Minot offers Zimmerman a
        great deal of money to kill the gangster. Zimmermann initially turns
        Minot down, but becomes greatly distressed by the thought that he may
        not have long to live and wants to provide for his wife and son. He
        agrees to go to France with Minot for a second medical opinion. Minot
        arranges to have the results falsified to make Zimmermann expect the
        worst. Zimmermann agrees to shoot the gangster in a Paris Métro station.
        Ripley visits Zimmermann in his shop before and after the shooting to
        get a picture framed. Zimmermann is unaware of Ripley's involvement in
        the murder plot, and the two begin to form a bond. Minot visits Ripley
        again to report his satisfaction with Zimmermann's performance. Ripley,
        who has grown to like Zimmerman, is appalled when Minot says he plans to
        have him murder another rival gangster, this time on a speeding train
        using a garrote. Before Zimmermann can complete the murder, the target's
        bodyguard catches him. Ripley appears on the train and overpowers him.
        Zimmermann and Ripley execute the target and the bodyguard. They meet
        outside and Ripley confesses to suggesting him to Minot, and declines
        Zimmermann's suggestion to keep half the money for the second hit.
        Ripley asks Zimmermann to tell Minot that he did the job on the train
        alone. Back home, Zimmermann argues with his wife, Marianne, who does
        not believe his stories of being paid to undergo experimental
        treatments. Zimmermann has been receiving mysterious phone calls and
        suspects the Mafia is trying to find him. His fears grow worse when
        Minot tells him that his own flat was recently bombed. Ripley picks up
        Zimmermann and they drive to his mansion to wait for the assassins
        Ripley expects to appear. Ripley and Zimmermann ambush and kill the
        assassins. Ripley piles their bodies into the ambulance in which they
        arrived. Before he and Zimmermann can leave to dispose of the bodies,
        Marianne arrives and tells Zimmermann that the French medical reports
        are fake. Ripley explains that she and her husband can settle matters
        later, but now they need to dispose of the bodies. They drive to the
        sea, Ripley in the ambulance and Marianne driving her husband in their
        car. On an isolated beach, Ripley douses the ambulance with gasoline and
        sets fire to it. Zimmermann drives away with Marianne, abandoning
        Ripley. Moments later, he dies at the wheel; Marianne pulls the
        emergency brake and survives. At the beach, Ripley says to himself, "We
        made it anyway, Jonathan. Be careful."

      <h1>Production</h1>
      <p>
        Wenders was a fan of Patricia Highsmith and wanted to adapt one of her
        novels to film, especially The Tremor of Forgery or The Cry of the Owl.
        When he learned that the rights to these novels and Highsmith's other
        novels had been sold, he met with her and she offered him the
        unpublished manuscript of Ripley's Game, which was published in
        1974.[2][3] Wenders also uses elements of Ripley Under Ground, though he
        did not have the rights to do so. Wenders wanted to cast John Cassavetes
        as Ripley, who declined and suggested Hopper for the part. After casting
        Hopper, an experienced director, Wenders decided to cast directors in
        all the gangster roles, including Gérard Blain, Nicholas Ray, and Samuel
        Fuller. He disliked the title Ripley's Game and shot the film under the
        title Framed.[2] He also considered the title Rule Without Exception. He
        credits Hopper with suggesting the title The American Friend.[2][3]
        American popular music is heard at several points in the film. Ripley
        quotes the song "Ballad of Easy Rider" from Easy Rider, a film Hopper
        directed and starred in, and Bob Dylan's "One More Cup of Coffee" and "I
        Pity the Poor Immigrant." Zimmermann plays or sings songs by The Kinks,
        "Too Much on My Mind" and "Nothin' in the World Can Stop Me Worryin'
        'Bout That Girl", in his shop. Summer in the City, Wenders's first
        full-length feature film, was dedicated to The Kinks. Ripley tells
        Zimmermann that he's "bringing the Beatles back to Hamburg," and
        Zimmermann quotes their song "Drive My Car" later in the film.
